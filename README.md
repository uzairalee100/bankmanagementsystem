# bankmanagementsystem

Project Description
This project is a Bank Management System featuring a simulated ATM-style GUI interface, designed to mimic real-world banking operations. It is developed in Java using NetBeans and uses MySQL for backend data management.

The system allows users to sign up, log in, and perform various banking activities such as depositing money, withdrawing cash, fast cash, checking balance, changing PIN, and viewing mini statements. A multi-step signup process ensures secure account registration, and all transactions are logged with timestamps.
